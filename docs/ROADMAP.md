## Active Issues & Near-Term Fixes

### 1. Hedera Wallet Authentication (IN PROGRESS)
**Status:** HashConnect integration working, requires WalletConnect v2 projectId

**Background:**
- HashConnect v3 is deprecated and will be shut down by 2026
- HashConnect now requires a valid WalletConnect v2 projectId to function
- Current implementation uses HashConnect for wallet pairing and transaction signing

**Current Setup:**
```
WalletConnect v2 ProjectId: 362a76563f2a3eca3d3c65661003d87b
Environment Variable: VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID
```

**Files Involved:**
- `packages/auth/hedera-wallet/src/services/HederaAuthService.ts` - Core wallet service
- `packages/auth/hedera-wallet/src/react/HederaAuthProvider.tsx` - React provider
- `client/src/main.tsx` - Config initialization
- `.env` - Wallet credentials

**What Works Now:**
- Wallet detection (HashPack, Blade, WalletConnect)
- Pairing modal opens correctly
- Session management and caching
- Family creation/joining logic

**What Needs Verification:**
- [ ] Test wallet connection with actual HashPack extension
- [ ] Test transaction signing flow
- [ ] Verify balance fetching from Mirror Node
- [ ] Test with Blade Wallet
- [ ] Test with WalletConnect modal

## Medium-Term Roadmap (Q1 2025)

### 2. Full WalletConnect v2 Migration
**Priority:** HIGH (before HashConnect shutdown in 2026)

**Plan:**
1. Implement WalletConnect v2 as primary authentication method
2. Keep HashConnect v3 as fallback during transition period
3. Dual-stack support for both wallet protocols
4. Feature flag to disable HashConnect if needed

**Migration Steps:**
```typescript
// Phase 1: Add WalletConnect v2 alongside HashConnect
// Phase 2: Test both pathways in parallel
// Phase 3: Make WalletConnect v2 default
// Phase 4: Remove HashConnect dependency (2025-2026)
```

### 3. Enhanced Wallet Features
- Token swapping and DEX integration
- Multi-wallet account management
- Wallet transaction history
- Real-time balance updates using Mirror Node subscriptions

## Long-Term Roadmap (2025+)

### 4. Agent Incentivization & Multi-Agent Marketplace (PRIORITY Q1 2025)
**Vision:** Agents autonomously compete to improve verifiable family bond metrics and earn FAM tokens for successful outcomes—creating aligned, outcome-based incentives.

**Phase 4c: A2A Protocol & Agent-to-Agent Trading** (Planned)
- Enable agents to trade resources autonomously:
  - Tool licensing: Intimacy Agent → Wisdom Agent (conflict frameworks)
  - Insight trading: Aggregated, privacy-preserved patterns ("Families with profile X respond to intervention Y")
  - Compute resources: Hedera consensus proof generation trades
  - Capability augmentation: Agents combine strengths
- Create on-chain A2A transaction log (immutable audit trail)
- Multi-agent collaboration improves overall family outcomes

### 5. Hedera Token Service (HTS) Integration
- Create and manage family tokens
- Token-based reward distribution (agent payouts + family incentives)
- NFT-based family member badges (milestones, engagement)
- Token governance for family decisions

### 6. Hedera Consensus Service (HCS)
- Family activity logging on-chain
- Immutable family records
- Distributed decision-making logs
- Cross-family consensus protocols
- Agent performance & payout verification logs

### 7. Smart Contract Services
- Family treasury smart contracts
- Automated agent reward distribution (based on bond score)
- Multi-signature wallet contracts
- Governance DAOs per family
- Agent performance escrow (verify outcomes before releasing payments)

### 8. Scaling & Performance
- Optimize Mirror Node queries
- Implement caching layer for account data
- Batch transaction processing
- Real-time WebSocket updates

## Configuration Reference

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# WalletConnect v2 Configuration
VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=362a76563f2a3eca3d3c65661003d87b

# Hedera Network Configuration
VITE_HEDERA_NETWORK=testnet

# Application URLs
VITE_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

### Development Mode
- Set `debug: true` in wallet config for enhanced logging
- Use `VITE_HEDERA_NETWORK=testnet` for development
- HashPack extension required for browser testing

---

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue: "Unauthorized: invalid key" WebSocket Error
**Cause:** Invalid or missing WalletConnect projectId
**Solution:** Ensure `VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` is set to valid v2 projectId
**Reference:** https://cloud.walletconnect.com/

### Issue: Pairing Modal Not Appearing
**Cause:** HashConnect service not initialized before connection attempt
**Solution:** Ensure `await authService.initialize()` is called in React Provider
**Status:** ✅ FIXED in latest provider update
